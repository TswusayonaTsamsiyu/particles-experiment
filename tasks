1. Threshold:
    1.1 Adaptive threshold
    1.2 Mix mean, STD, max
    1.3 Maybe combine 1.1 and 1.2
    1.4 Constant threshold (for the whole video)
2. Has tracks & find background:
    2.1 Has contours of min size
    2.2 Mix mean, STD, max
    2.3 Maybe combine 2.1 and 2.2
3. Contours:
    3.1 Area
    3.2 Length and width
    3.3 Curl
4. Track tracks (contours) through the video, and find the most relevant frame
5. Distinguishes between different kinds of tracks
    5.1 Read article about ML training model of tracks
