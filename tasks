2. Join contours of broken tracks
3. Contours:
    3.1 Area
    3.2 Length and width
    3.3 Curvature
    3.4 Make sure area, length, width actually compute what we want
4. Track tracks (contours) through the video, and find the most relevant frame
5. Distinguishes between different kinds of tracks
    5.1 Read article about ML training model of tracks
